By default, Docker runs through a non-networked UNIX socket. It can also
optionally communicate using an HTTP socket.

デフォルトで Docker は、インターネットを介さない UNIX ソケットを通じて実行されます。
HTTPS ソケットを用いた通信を行うこともできます。

If you need Docker to be reachable through the network in a safe manner, you can
enable TLS by specifying the `tlsverify` flag and pointing Docker's
`tlscacert` flag to a trusted CA certificate.

In the daemon mode, it only allows connections from clients
authenticated by a certificate signed by that CA. In the client mode,
it only connects to servers with a certificate signed by that CA.

    What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
    There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
    For some fields there will be a default value,

signing request (CSR). Make sure that "Common Name" matches the hostname you use

If you want to secure your Docker client connections by default, you can move
the files to the `.docker` directory in your home directory --- and set the
`DOCKER_HOST` and `DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY` variables as well (instead of passing
`-H=tcp://$HOST:2376` and `--tlsverify` on every call).

If found, the client sends its client certificate, so you just need
to drop your keys into `~/.docker/{ca,cert,key}.pem`. Alternatively,
if you want to store your keys in another location, you can specify that
location using the environment variable `DOCKER_CERT_PATH`.
