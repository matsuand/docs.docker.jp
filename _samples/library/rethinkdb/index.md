# What is RethinkDB?

RethinkDB is an open-source, distributed database built to store JSON documents and effortlessly scale to multiple machines. It's easy to set up and learn and features a simple but powerful query language that supports table joins, groupings, aggregations, and functions.

# How to use this image

## Start an instance with data mounted in the working directory

The default CMD of the image is `rethinkdb --bind all`, so the RethinkDB daemon will bind to all network interfaces available to the container (by default, RethinkDB only accepts connections from `localhost`).

```bash
docker run --name some-rethink -v "$PWD:/data" -d rethinkdb
```

## Connect the instance to an application

```bash
docker run --name some-app --link some-rethink:rdb -d application-that-uses-rdb
```

## Connecting to the web admin interface on the same host

```bash
$BROWSER "http://$(docker inspect --format \
  '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' some-rethink):8080"
```

# Connecting to the web admin interface on a remote / virtual host via SSH

Where `remote` is an alias for the remote user@hostname:

```bash
# start port forwarding
ssh -fNTL localhost:8080:$(ssh remote "docker inspect --format \
  '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' some-rethink"):8080 remote

# open interface in browser
xdg-open http://localhost:8080

# stop port forwarding
kill $(lsof -t -i @localhost:8080 -sTCP:listen)
```

## Configuration

See the [official docs](http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/) for infomation on using and configuring a RethinkDB cluster.
