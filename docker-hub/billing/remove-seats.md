You can manage your Docker Hub subscription anytime by removing seats from your plan. If you remove seats in the middle of the billing cycle, changes will be applied immediately and the changes will be reflected in the next billing cycle.

For example, if you receive your billing on the 8th of every month for 10 seats and you choose to remove 2 seats on the 15th of the month, the 2 seats will be removed immediately. You will start paying for 8 seats from the next billing cycle.
