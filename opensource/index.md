  This is similar to clicking **Request doc changes** on a published docs

- Fork the documentation, make changes or add new content on your local

  This is the manual, more advanced version of clicking **Edit this page**
  on a published docs page. Initiating a docs changes in a PR from your
  own branch gives you more flexibility, as you can submit changes to
  multiple pages or files under a single pull request, and even create
  new topics.
